		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES

There's an array of 6 sectors in our filesystem on-disk inodes. For large 
files, 5 of these are indirect sectors, meaning they hold the sector 
numbers of 128 other data sectors. The 6th sector is double indirect, 
which holds the sector numbers of 128 indirect sectors. 
This adds to 512 bytes per sector * (5*128 + 1*128^2) = 8,716,288 bytes

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

When a file attempts any reads or writes, it's locked by a shared reader/
writer lock. There can be multiple readers, but when one writes, the writer
must acquire exclusive access. Then the file will be appeneded to.

Our code doesn't implement this, but a way to do so would be to have an
interrupt access the cache and force all processes holding locks on
cache blocks to release. This would be similar in design as flushing
the cache every 30 seconds.

---- RATIONALE ----

We have two inode structure setups, small and large. Inodes representing small
files just hold an array of 6 sectors. Each sector holds 512 bytes. We have 
such a simple case because most files are small enough to fit into just a 
small inode structure.
Our second inode structure, the large structure, is 5 indirect and 1 doubly
indirect inode. We chose this large file size because it was just enough to 
fit the entire partition given to pintos during testing.
We allocate sectors as they are needed. For example, say a completely filled
small file needs one more byte. This won't fit in a small file, so the entire
inode is upgraded and bytes are read into the first indirect sector of a large 
file. There's now an overhead of one sector; 7 to hold the file data, and 1 to
inderectly encapsulate the 7 data sectors. There would be 1 page of overhead 
for each indirect sector we use and a maximum of 129 pages of overhead 
attributed to the doubly indirect sector. This is relatively small overhead
considering the theoretical capacity we are adding to the file.

In cache.h
----------

The enums are to distinguish the different types of data that could be in the
cache.

enum sector_type
  {
    FILE_DATA = 1,     /* Cached fileblock represents file data. */
    INODE_DATA = 2,    /* Cached fileblock represents inode. */
    INODE_METADATA = 3 /* Cached fileblock represents inode metadata. */
  };
/* frames a single block of the buffer cache */
struct cache_block
  {
    struct hash_elem elem;          /* Element in a hash by sector. */
    block_sector_t sector;          /* Sector number to hash with. */
    char accessed;                  /* For reads or writes. */
    bool removed;                   /* Allocated or not. */
    bool dirty;                     /* Recent write access. */
    enum sector_type type;          /* Type of fileblock for eviction. */
    struct shared_lock spot_lock;   /* Shared lock for eviction/fetching. */
    char data[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE];   /* Fileblock data. */
  };

struct lock GENGAR; /* Temporary rigid lock solution to unsyncronized 
                       cache accesses */

We have cache_pin and cache_unpin functions, but we didn't have time
to incorporate them at the end of the night.

In cache.c
----------
struct buffer_cache
  {
    struct bitmap *used_blocks;  /* Bitmap representing used cache blocks. */
    struct hash cache_segment;   /* Quick way to lookup cached sectors. */
    struct cache_block *used_sectors[CACHE_MAX]; /* array of cache blocks. */
    int cursor;                  /* Keep track of clock hand. */
    int evicting_hand;           /* Controls eviction from buffer cache. */ 
  };

We incorporated all a bitmap, array, and hash for to have a range of benefits
including fast lookups (hash), simple indexing (array), and quickly finding
free cache blocks (bitmap). Diversity is power!

struct cache_block
  {
    struct hash_elem elem; /* To store in a cache hash. */
    block_sector_t sector; /* Data sector in filesys for this block. */
    enum sector_type type; /* Type of data in this sector. */
    char data[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE]; /*  Storage for sector data. */
    char accessed;         /* For reads or writes. */
    bool in_use;           /* For tracking if any process is using block. */
    bool dirty;            /* For writes only. */
  };
---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

We use a clock algorithm to replace cache blocks. The cache is internally stored
as a hash that links sector numbers to buckets of the hash. The clock algorithm
however, circles around a statically sized array. The cursor hand goes through
and will either it will decrement the cache block's usage frequency. The
evicting hand will delete a cache block from the array, return the index it
deleted at. This index will either be a position of a cache block that was freed
since the last time the eviction mechanism was invoked or a cache block whose
usage frequency was decremented to zero by the cursor before.
We chose to represent the clock as an array because it's easy to continuously
loop through an array of 64 elements, and replacing evicted or deleted cache
blocks with new ones is constant time after a position is found. The parallel
hash allows for contant time lookup into the cache when something tries to
access file data. Using both data structures gives us the best of both worlds.
